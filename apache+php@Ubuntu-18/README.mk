The Dockerfile is pulling an official ubuntu image via ubuntu:latest. It is important to note that using 'latest' tag can break the build process if the base image was changed, so in some cases it is better to use a specific tag. Also, the host running the Docker engine has been configured with the environment variable export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1. This environment variable will ensure that the Docker engine verifies the publisher of the image being pulled and its integrity.
